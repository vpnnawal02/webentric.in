const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "What is the difference between a website and a web application?",
        answer: "A website presents information — visitors read about your services and contact you. A web application is a working system your team logs into daily: dashboards, bookings, records and reports that update in real time. Many businesses eventually need both, each built for its own job.",
    },
    {
        question: "What technology do you build web apps with?",
        answer: "The interface is built in React with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, data and authentication run on Firebase or Supabase, and outside services connect through REST API integration. It is a clean, modern stack that stays maintainable as the application grows.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can our team have logins with different permissions?",
        answer: "Yes. Every application ships with secure login and role-based access — owners, managers, staff and even clients can each have a view matched to their responsibility, with sensitive areas kept restricted.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can the app connect to tools or data we already use?",
        answer: "In most cases, yes. We connect through REST APIs wherever the other service allows it, and we map existing spreadsheets into structured data during setup — so you start from your real records, not a blank slate.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can it handle bookings, leads and payments?",
        answer: "Yes. Lead capture, slot booking and follow-up stages are built around how your team sells, with WhatsApp and SMTP notifications on every movement and Razorpay, Stripe, UPI or PayPal collection wired into the workflow.",
    },
    {
        question: "Who maintains the application after launch?",
        answer: "We do. After a guided rollout and training for your team, we stay on for fixes, improvements and upkeep — and because the system is built module by module, new workflows can be added without rebuilding what works.",
    },

                        A website tells people who you are. A web application does the work alongside you — your
                        team logs in each morning to manage bookings, track leads, check dashboards and update
                        records. If your day runs inside a browser tab, you need the second kind.
