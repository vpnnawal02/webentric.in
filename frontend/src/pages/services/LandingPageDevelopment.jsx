const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "How is a landing page different from a website?",
        answer: "A website serves many visitors with many goals — browsing services, reading about you, finding contact details. A landing page serves one campaign with one goal: a call, a form fill or a WhatsApp chat. Everything on it points at that single action.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you help with the headline and copy structure?",
        answer: "Yes. We structure the hero promise, benefit order, proof sections and calls to action around your offer and audience, then write the first draft for your approval. You bring the domain knowledge; we bring the page logic.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do enquiries reach us?",
        answer: "Through short lead forms that ask only what you need, with instant WhatsApp handover for visitors who prefer to chat and SMTP email alerts so no enquiry sits unseen. Every submission is also tracked as an analytics event.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can we test two versions of the page?",
        answer: "Yes. Pages are built as swappable blocks — headlines, offers, visuals and form placement can each vary independently — so you can run A/B comparisons on your ad platform without rebuilding the page.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will we know which ad or section brings leads?",
        answer: "Yes. Clicks, scroll depth and form starts are recorded as analytics events, and campaign tags from your ads carry through to the page. You can see which message and which section earned each enquiry.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you update the page when our offer changes?",
        answer: "Yes. Because the page is built from independent sections, offers, prices-in-words and seasonal campaigns can be swapped without touching the rest. We also stay on for ongoing tweaks and upkeep.",
    },

                        Advertisements earn the click; the page earns the enquiry. When someone arrives from a
                        campaign and meets a slow, generic homepage, most of that ad spend quietly leaves. A
                        dedicated page keeps one promise, one audience and one action.

                        Our approach to landing page development is simple: one page, one offer, one action. Every
                        section answers the visitor&apos;s next doubt in order, loads fast on mobile data, and
                        records exactly which parts pull their weight.
