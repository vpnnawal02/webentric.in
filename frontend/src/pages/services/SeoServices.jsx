const DESCRIPTION =
    "Honest SEO for Delhi and India businesses: technical fixes, on-page optimisation, local SEO, and speed work. No ranking guarantees — just groundwork that helps customers find you.";

const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Do you guarantee first-page rankings?",
        answer: "No — and you should be cautious of anyone who does. Nobody controls Google's results, so a guaranteed position is not something any honest provider can offer. What we do guarantee is thorough, transparent work: we document every fix and change, and report on visibility, traffic, and enquiries so you can judge progress yourself.",
    },
    {
        question: "What does the technical side involve?",
        answer: "We check how search engines experience your site: crawlability, index coverage, sitemaps, redirects, broken links, mobile usability, page speed, and Core Web Vitals. Issues we find are fixed directly or handed to you as a clear, prioritised list.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you manage our Google Business Profile?",
        answer: "We guide you through claiming, verifying, and completing it — categories, services, hours, photos, and service areas — and show you how to handle reviews and updates. Day-to-day posting and review replies stay with you, since customers trust replies that come directly from the business itself.",
    },
    {
        question: "What do you change on the pages themselves?",
        answer: "Titles, descriptions, headings, internal links, image descriptions, and URL structure — plus guidance on how each page's content should be organised so both readers and search engines understand what it covers. We never stuff pages with awkward repeated phrases.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long until we see movement?",
        answer: "It varies with your starting point, your competitors, and how much fixing is needed — visibility usually builds gradually rather than overnight. We set expectations honestly after the initial audit and report on leading indicators like index coverage and impressions, not just final positions.",
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from us to begin?",
        answer: "Access to your website and analytics, a list of the services and areas you want to be found for, and one conversation about your customers. From there we run the audit and agree on priorities together.",
    },

                        When someone nearby searches for what you offer, your business should be
                        easy to find. Our approach to search optimisation for Delhi and
                        India-based businesses covers the groundwork that matters: technical
                        health, clear on-page signals, local visibility, and fast-loading pages.

                    <p>
                        Search visibility compounds over time — there are no shortcuts and no
                        credible promises of specific positions. What we offer instead is careful,
                        transparent work: fixes you can verify, reports you can understand, and a
                        site that earns its place in the results.
