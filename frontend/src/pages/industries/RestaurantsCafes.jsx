const DESCRIPTION =
    "Restaurant and cafe websites that turn hungry searches into footfall — menus, hours, location, photos, and WhatsApp reservation paths, tuned for phones.";

const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Can customers see our menu without downloading a PDF?",
        answer: "Yes. Menus are built as readable pages — categories, items, and prices that load instantly on a phone and can be updated when dishes or rates change. No downloads, no pinching and zooming on a scanned file.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do table bookings work on the site?",
        answer: "Through a WhatsApp reservation path: party size, date, and time are pre-filled into the message, so the booking lands in your chat ready to confirm. It suits how most diners in India actually reserve — a quick message, not a long form or an account.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will the site load fast on mobile data?",
        answer: "Yes. Food photography is compressed carefully so pages stay appetising without turning heavy, and layouts are kept lean for visitors searching on the move — often standing nearby deciding where to eat.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can we update timings, specials, and holiday hours?",
        answer: "Yes. Menus, specials, and hours are structured for quick edits, and our website maintenance service can apply changes — festive hours, new dishes, price updates — so the site never shows last season's information.",
    },
];

    },
    {
        title: "Hours, address, and map",
        text: "Opening hours with holiday variations, an embedded map, and nearby landmarks. Most dining decisions end with one question: how do I get there, and is it open?",
    },
    {
        title: "Photography that whets appetite",
        text: "Interiors, signature dishes, and ambience shots — compressed so they load fast. Diners choose with their eyes long before they read a word.",
    },
    {
        title: "WhatsApp reservations",
        text: "One-tap table requests with party size, date, and time pre-filled. Low friction for the diner, an organised message thread for your staff.",
    },
    {
        title: "Search-friendly basics",
        text: "Semantic structure, clear headings, and clean URLs so your menu and location pages can surface when someone searches for your cuisine nearby.",
    },
    {
        title: "Reviews and social proof",
        text: "Direct paths to your review profiles and Instagram, plus space for press mentions. A diner choosing between two cafes picks the one others visibly enjoyed.",

                        Nobody chooses dinner from a desktop. Your visitors are on phones,
                        often already nearby, asking four things: what&apos;s on the menu,
                        what does it cost, are you open, and where exactly are you. If any
                        answer hides behind a PDF download or a slow gallery, they tap
                        back to the next listing.

                        We build dining sites around that moment of hunger: instant menu
                        pages, accurate hours and maps, photography that loads fast on
                        mobile data, and WhatsApp reservation paths that convert a craving
                        into a confirmed table. Discovery from search plus a frictionless
                        booking step is what turns traffic into footfall.
