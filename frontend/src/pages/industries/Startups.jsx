const DESCRIPTION =
    "Launch-ready startup websites — sharp positioning, an investor-friendly story, waitlist capture, and analytics-ready builds that move at startup speed.";

const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "How fast can we launch?",
        answer: "Speed depends mostly on content readiness — positioning, product screenshots, and team details. We usually start with a sharp landing page that captures signups, then expand into deeper pages once your messaging settles, so you are never waiting on a months-long build to start talking to users.",
    },
    {
        question: "Should we start with a landing page or a full site?",
        answer: "If you are validating or pre-launch, a focused landing page with waitlist capture is the right call. If you are raising or selling, add story pages — problem, solution, traction, team — so investors and early customers find answers without a call. Either way the base is built to grow, not to be thrown away.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can the site grow into a product or dashboard later?",
        answer: "Yes. We build on React with a backend-ready setup on Firebase or Supabase, so waitlist forms today can become auth, dashboards, or CRM-style views tomorrow without starting over. Scope is phased deliberately so the MVP stays lean.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will we be able to measure signups and traffic sources?",
        answer: "Yes. Page and event tracking is wired in from day one — signups, button clicks, and traffic sources — so you can see which channel and which message actually convert instead of guessing after a launch.",
    },

                        An early-stage company lives on speed and credibility at once:
                        ship before the pitch, look fundable before the traction. Founders
                        juggle landing copy, investor questions, and a product that keeps
                        changing — while scope creep quietly eats the runway the site was
                        meant to protect.

                        We build launch-first sites for startups: a sharp landing page that
                        captures waitlist signups now, story pages that carry the pitch
                        later, and an analytics-ready base that grows into dashboards and
