const DESCRIPTION =
    "Gym and fitness studio websites that turn visits into trials — membership plans, class timetables, trainer profiles, result photos, and WhatsApp trial booking.";

const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Can visitors book a free trial from the site?",
        answer: "Yes. A trial button on every key page opens a WhatsApp message pre-filled with the visitor's interest — trial class, timing, goal — so your team gets a warm lead to confirm instead of a cold form submission to chase.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do we show class timings clearly?",
        answer: "As a proper timetable: batches by day and time, discipline per batch, and the trainer taking it. Morning and evening splits, weekend variations, and holiday pauses are all structured so members check the site instead of calling the front desk.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can we present our trainers and their specialities?",
        answer: "Yes. Each trainer gets a profile with photo, certifications, and specialities like strength, conditioning, yoga, or personal training. People commit to coaches, not equipment lists — visible trainers shorten that decision.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens when plans or timings change?",
        answer: "Plans, batches, and holiday schedules change through the year. The site is structured for quick edits, and our website maintenance service applies updates — new batches, revised plans, festive closures — so members always see current information.",
    },
];

const NEEDS = [

    },
    {
        title: "Class timetables",
        text: "Batch timings by day, discipline per batch, and trainer per session. Clear schedules cut front-desk calls and help prospects picture their own week.",
    },
    {
        title: "Trainer profiles",
        text: "Photos, certifications, and specialities for every coach. A prospect choosing between two gyms often decides on the trainer they want to learn from.",
    },
    {
        title: "Trial booking via WhatsApp",
        text: "Pre-filled trial requests from every page — goal, preferred timing, location. The lowest-friction step between curiosity and walking through your door.",
    },
    {
        title: "Results galleries",
        text: "Member transformations and training photos, shared with consent. Real progress from real members persuades more than any equipment inventory.",
    },
    {
        title: "Timings, location, and contact",
        text: "Morning and evening splits, holiday closures, an embedded map, and direct call paths — the practical details that decide whether someone shows up tomorrow.",

                        A fitness membership is a commitment decision, and prospects
                        research it like one: which plans exist, when batches run, who
                        the trainers are, and whether a trial is possible before paying.
                        A gym site that shows only equipment photos and a phone number
                        leaves every real question unanswered.

                    <p>
                        We build studio sites around the trial funnel — plans prospects
                        can compare, timetables they can picture themselves in, trainer
                        profiles that earn confidence, and WhatsApp trial booking from
                        every page. The goal is simple: turn an evening of comparison
                        browsing into a Monday morning visit.
