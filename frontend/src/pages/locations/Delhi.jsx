const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Can we meet in person before starting the project?",
        answer: "Yes. We are based in New Delhi, so an in-person meeting in Delhi can usually be arranged for discovery or key reviews. Most clients still prefer calls and WhatsApp for day-to-day updates because decisions move faster that way.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical Delhi project take?",
        answer: "A straightforward business website usually takes a few weeks from content sign-off to launch, while ecommerce builds, booking flows, or custom dashboards take longer. After a short discovery conversation we confirm a written timeline before work begins.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is pricing worked out for a website?",
        answer: "Every project is quoted individually in rupees after we understand your pages, features, and integrations. A simple informational site costs far less than a store or a portal with logins, and you receive a fixed written quote within 24 hours on business days.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you only serve certain parts of Delhi?",
        answer: "No. We serve businesses across South Delhi, West Delhi, North Delhi, East Delhi, and New Delhi on the same terms. Location within the city does not change the process, the pricing, or the level of support.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will you look after the site after it goes live?",
        answer: "Yes. We offer website maintenance for updates, backups, small content changes, and monitoring, plus ongoing SEO services if you want to keep growing search visibility after launch.",
    },

                        Delhi is our home ground. Webentric is based in New Delhi, and the businesses we build for here
                        are the ones we know best — South Delhi clinics, boutiques, and consultancies that live on
                        reputation; West Delhi traders and retailers who need catalogues customers can browse on a phone;
                        North Delhi coaching centres and institutions with admissions to fill; East Delhi service firms
                        competing on responsiveness. Each pocket of the city buys differently, and the sites we design
                        reflect that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being local means the practical things are easy: an in-person meeting can be arranged when it
                        matters, references are nearby, and support runs on your working hours. Most of the engagement
                        still happens remotely — shared previews, calls, and WhatsApp — so projects move quickly without
                        losing the directness of working with a team from your own city. If you are comparing options
                        for a website development company in Delhi, start with a conversation and a written quote, not a
                        sales deck.
