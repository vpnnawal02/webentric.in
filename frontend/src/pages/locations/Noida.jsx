const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Do you work with early-stage startups in Noida?",
        answer: "Yes, regularly. Startup engagements usually start lean — a sharp landing page or a compact marketing site that can grow into a fuller product later. The React base we build on means dashboards and internal tools can be added without starting over.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can we meet in person in Noida?",
        answer: "Yes. We are based in New Delhi, so Noida is a short trip and an in-person meeting can be arranged for kickoffs or key reviews. Day-to-day collaboration runs over calls and WhatsApp, which keeps feedback cycles tight.",
    },
    {
        question: "How fast can a startup website go live?",
        answer: "A focused landing page or a compact site can move from content sign-off to launch in a matter of weeks; larger marketing sites, portals, or stores take longer. You get a written timeline with your quote before any work starts.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do you charge for projects?",
        answer: "Every quote is fixed and written in rupees after a discovery conversation about scope. Startup founders often begin with a landing page or a small site and extend it as traction grows, which keeps the initial outlay sensible.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide ongoing support after launch?",
        answer: "Yes. Website maintenance covers updates, backups, and small changes, and SEO services are available when you are ready to invest in organic visibility. Many startup clients keep us on for iterative improvements between funding rounds.",
    },

                        Noida runs on shipping speed. Between the Sector 62 and 63 IT corridor, the startups around
                        Sector 18 and the expressway, and the service firms filling every new tower, nobody here has
                        patience for a six-month website project. Webentric is based in nearby New Delhi and serves
                        Noida businesses remotely, with in-person meetings arranged when a kickoff or review warrants
                        one — a setup that matches how corridor teams already work.

                        For startups, the usual starting point is deliberately small: a landing page that captures a
                        launch, or a compact marketing site that makes a young company look credible to customers and
                        investors alike. Because everything is built on a React foundation with room for databases and
                        dashboards, that starting point grows with you. If you are evaluating a website development
                        company in Noida, judge us on how fast we get you to something real — then keep us around for
                        what comes next.
