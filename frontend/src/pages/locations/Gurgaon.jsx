const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Do you work with corporate clients in Gurgaon?",
        answer: "Yes. Corporate engagements usually involve more stakeholders, brand guidelines, and approval rounds, and our process is built for that — structured previews, documented revisions, and a single point of contact throughout.",
    },
    {
            question: "Can we meet in person in Gurgaon?",
        answer: "Yes, an in-person meeting can be arranged for discovery sessions or milestone reviews. Most collaboration still happens over calls and WhatsApp so approvals do not wait on calendars.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical project take?",
        answer: "A corporate marketing site or hospitality website usually moves from content sign-off to launch in a matter of weeks; ecommerce builds and custom portals take longer. Your written quote includes a confirmed timeline before work begins.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is pricing structured?",
        answer: "Projects are quoted individually in rupees after discovery — page count, integrations, and content requirements all shape the figure. You receive a fixed written quote within 24 hours on business days, with no hidden additions later.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you support the site after it launches?",
        answer: "Yes. Website maintenance covers updates, backups, and small content changes, and SEO services are available for brands competing in Gurgaon's crowded corporate and hospitality search results.",
    },

                        Gurgaon — Gurugram on official letterheads, Gurgaon in every conversation — sets a particular
                        bar. Cyber City headquarters, funded startups in shared workspaces, and hospitality brands along
                        Golf Course Road all judge a website the way they judge a pitch: quickly, and against serious
                        competition. Webentric is based in New Delhi and serves Gurgaon businesses remotely, with
                        in-person meetings arranged for discovery sessions and milestone reviews when face time earns its
                        keep.

                    <p>
                        What that clientele has in common is process discipline. Multiple stakeholders need to see
                        staged previews, brand guidelines need respecting rather than reinventing, and launch dates
                        often tie to campaigns that cannot slip. If you are shortlisting a website development company
                        in Gurgaon, that operational steadiness matters as much as the design portfolio — so our quotes
                        are fixed, our timelines are written, and our revision rounds are part of the plan, not an
                        afterthought.
